## Overview

Hey Linux friends! Pck3r makes Ubuntu 24.04 package management simple and fun. No more complex apt commands - just easy, memorable ones. Perfect for beginners and pros alike!

## Commands

### Install Command

Install packages or tools. Pck3r supports built-in installations for popular tools and falls back to apt for other packages.

Built-in packages (special installation methods):
- nodejs (Node.js)
- ohmyzsh (Oh My Zsh)
- firefox (Mozilla Firefox)
- google-chrome (Google Chrome)
- steam (Steam gaming platform)
- discord (Discord chat app)
- vscode (Visual Studio Code)
- skype (Skype)
- zoom (Zoom video conferencing)
- vlc (VLC media player)
- virtualbox (VirtualBox virtualization)
- wine (Wine for running Windows apps)

```bash
pck3r install <package>
```

Examples:
- `pck3r install nodejs`
- `pck3r install google-chrome`
- `pck3r install <any_other_package>` (uses apt)

### Clear Command

Clear your terminal screen:

```bash
pck3r clear
```

### System Commands

Manage your operating system:

- Update package lists:
  ```bash
  pck3r sys update
  ```

- Upgrade installed packages:
  ```bash
  pck3r sys upgrade
  ```

- Full upgrade (update and upgrade):
  ```bash
  pck3r sys updgr
  ```

### Package Commands

List built-in Pck3r packages or search for available apt packages:

- List built-in packages:
  ```bash
  pck3r pkg
  ```

- Check if a package is built-in or search for apt packages:
  ```bash
  pck3r pkg <package_name>
  ```

  If `<package_name>` is a built-in Pck3r package, it will notify you. Otherwise, it uses `apt search` to find available packages in the repositories.

### Version

Check Pck3r version:

```bash
pck3r version
```

## Web Interface

For a graphical web-based interface (Ubuntu 24.04 only), open `index.html` in your web browser. This provides a user-friendly way to install packages and run system commands without using the command line. The web interface displays the exact bash commands to run in your terminal for installation.
